This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental types of linked lists using the **C programming language**.
It covers:

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

Each implementation showcases essential operations such as:

- Insertion (at beginning, end, and specific position)
- Deletion (from beginning, end, and specific position)
- Display/Traversal
- Search (if applicable)

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- Dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and `free`
- Struct usage in C
- Pointer manipulation
- Forward and backward traversal
- Circular references

## ðŸš€ How to Compile and Run

Make sure you have GCC installed.

```bash
gcc singly_linked_list.c -o singly
./singly

gcc doubly_linked_list.c -o doubly
./doubly

gcc circular_linked_list.c -o circular
./circular
